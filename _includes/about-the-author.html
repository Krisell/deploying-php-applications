        <h2>About the author</h2>
            <p><b>My story</b></p>
            <p>I've been developing and deploying applications for over 15 years now. During this time I've learned a lot on what do to and what not to do, in terms of how to deploy applications. I've seen how beneficial a great deploy process can be for a team.</p>
            <p>You can find my blog at <a href="http://modess.io">modess.io</a> where I sometimes blog about deployment, sometimes I also <a href="http://modess.io/public-speaking">speak</a> at conferences and meetups on the topic.</p>
